  This code is for a simple weather app webpage that allows users to search for the weather in a given location. The webpage is designed to have a responsive layout, so it will look good on a desktop computer or a mobile device.
</p>

## Overview

The HTML file includes the basic structure of the webpage, including the header, search input field, and weather information card. The CSS file contains the styles for the webpage, including background colors, fonts, and layout. The JavaScript file includes the logic for getting weather data from an API and displaying it on the webpage. It uses the Fetch API to make requests to the OpenWeatherMap API, which provides current weather data for a given location.

## Features

- The background image is sourced from Unsplash, a website that provides free high-quality photos.
- The fonts are sourced from Google Fonts, which provides a wide variety of free and open-source fonts.
- The weather information card has a "loading" class that hides the weather information until it has been retrieved from the API. This gives the user a visual indication that the app is working and prevents the page from looking empty or incomplete while the data is being fetched.
- The search button includes an SVG icon that is styled with CSS to make it look like a simple button.
